Python 3.6.5 (System: Intel Core i5-7200U @ 2.5GHz, 64-bit, 8 GB RAM) 

Notes:
- Close each matplotlib window(shows the output) to continue execution
- You can also comment the code that makes these plots and uncomment the cv2.imsave part to save the images
- Threshold for RANSAC is set to 10 as it is appropriate generally for all images
- Number of iterations of RANSAC is 1000

## Image_Stitching

	1. Run as stated in the notes. You will be prompted to input the scene number. Enter either 1,2 or 3.
	2. First it will plot matched keypoints.
	3. After that Homography matrices will be printed on your screen
	4. Then image 1 and image 2 will be stitched and shown
	5. Then image 1,image 2 and image 3 will be stitched and shown
	6. Finally image 1,image 2, image 3 and image 4 will be stitched and shown	
	
	The steps 3,4,5 and 6 will again be repeated using Homography matrices generated by inbuilt functions.

## Image_Stitching_Depth

	1. Run as stated in the notes. You will be prompted to input the scene number. Enter either 1,2 or 3.
	2. First the homography matrices for each depth level will be shown.
	3. Then ref_image and source_image are stitched and shown.
	4. Single homography matrix is printed
	5. Image stitched using single homography matrix is shown	


Outputs folder is also present which is the saved version of each image generated by the algorithm.
